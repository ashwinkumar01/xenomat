INSTALLING THE XENO TOOLS
=========================

On the host:

  cd xeno/tools
  ./run-xeno
  
On the Q.reader:

  Logon as root (password: geagea), stay in /root (run "pwd" to be sure), and execute the following:

  curl http://<Host-IP>:8901/xeno/bootstrap/qreader | /bin/sh

On a Raspberry Pi:

  Logon as pi (password: (default)raspberry), stay in ~/ (run "pwd" to be sure), and execute the following:

  curl http://<Host-IP>:8901/xeno/bootstrap/pi | /bin/sh

On any Debian(ese) Linux:

  Pretty much like the above, using
  
  curl http://<Host-IP>:8901/xeno/bootstrap/debian | /bin/sh

RUNNING THE XENO TOOLS
======================
Make sure the builder is running on the host (see above).

load xeno
  Will transfer the netropy executable to $PWD
  
load gins
  Will transfer the libgins-netropy.so library to $PWD

load xml
  Will transfer the XML file and support files to $PWD
  
run
  Will execute the program, using the files in $PWD.
  Do not forget to stop the system with "stop" first!

stop
  Will stop the program (if it is running).
  
install
  Will copy the files in /root to their proper places.
  Do not forget to stop the Q.reader system with "qreader_ctrl stop" first,
  and to restart it with "qreader_ctrl start" afterwards.
